# WpfMockupApp8
 Wpf Mockup Program for .NET 8 . Not intended to be robust fully featured program.

Just put code in C:\WpfMockupApp8\WpfMockupApp8 and double check that MOCK_DATA.csv is in the Data subdirectory.
So the hard coded data path is only used for this mockup program so do not need a database.
