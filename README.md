# WpfMockupApp8
 Wpf Mockup Program for .NET 8 . Not intended to be robust fully featured program.

 Purpose:  Just to show WPF in .NET 8 environment. 
 This should show the customer data with a grid on left and detail screen on right of the current selection.

Just put code in C:\WpfMockupApp8\WpfMockupApp8 and double check that MOCK_DATA.csv is in the Data subdirectory.
So the hard coded data path is only used for this mockup program so do not need a database.

If need new location, then just change PersonViewModel.cs in the ViewModels folder, 
setting the filePath to the new location.

See WpfMockupApp8_RunningExample.jpg for its appearing when running.
